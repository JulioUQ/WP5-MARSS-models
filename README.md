## Multivariate Autoregressive State-Space (MARSS) models to examine stock structure of Greenland halibut in the North Atlantic.

Exploited marine resources can be managed more effectively when accurate information on population structure is available.    

### General information for survey data included in the study.
Greenland halibut in the North Atlantic is managed as four separated offshore stocks. Here, we use Multivariate Autoregressive State-Space (MARSS) models to analyze abundance trends for three of these stocks: (1) the Baffin Bay- Davis Strait (located between Northeast Canada - West Greenland) (Northwest Atlantic Stock, NWAS), (2) the East Greenland, Iceland and Faroes waters (West Nordic Stock, WNS) and (3) the Barents Sea and Norwegian seas (Northeast Arctic Stock, NEAS).
| Stock | Country | Survey | Location | Time series|
| :---: |  :---:  |  :---: | :---:    | :---:| 
| Northeast Arctic (NEA) | Norway | Norwegian slope |ICES Subareas 1 and 2 | 1996-2019|
| West Nordic (WN) | Iceland | Icelandic | ICES Subareas 5,6 and 12 | 1996-2019|
| West Nordic (WN) | Greenland | East Greenland|ICES Subdivision 14b | 1998-2017|
|Northwest Atlantic (NWA) |Greenland and Canada | West Greenland and Canadian (combined)| NAFO Divs. 1CD + 0A-South|1997-2019

### Sampling areas.
Bottom trawl survey data from each region for the period 1996-2019 were used to formulate hypotheses on different populations structures.

### Population distribution scenarios (Z). 
Nine model alternatives included different levels of parameter complexity and covariates to investigate the impact of the climate and the fishing on the populations.
**Time-series:** West Greenland and Canada (**WGR**); East Greenland (**EGR**); Iceland (**ICE**); and Norwegian slope (**NEA**).
